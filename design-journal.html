        <h2>Week One</h2>
        <p>Prompt: What do you hope to achieve in this class by the end of the term? Are there special projects or technologies you’d like to see covered by the end of the term? Is there a site (or two) that gives you butterflies in your stomach? What is it?</p>
        <p>Response: Something that I hope to achieve by the end of this term is to have a basic understanding of coding—I think that it is a skill that can definitely help my portfolio, and one that is heavily needed in the virtual design world. One of the things that I would like to see covered in this course is how to automate items on a webpage, such as a rotating photo gallery or text in-between the header and the main pages.

          A website that I enjoy would probably be Chip and Joanna Gaines’ Magnolia Website, as a huge fan of watching HGTV; I also enjoy the way their website is mapped out. </p>

        <h2>Week Two</h2>
        <p>Prompt: What are you planning to do for project 1? What content do you plan to show? How will you make each page unique while maintaining a cohesive design across the project? How will your color palette, imagery, and typography choice complement your subject matter?</p>
        <p>Response: I am planning on creating a website inspired by the French Impressionist Oscar-Claude Monet. Showcasing his life, philosophy, impressionist movement, as well as his painted works. For the most part how I’m planning on making each page unique in using various layouts of text to images—marked within certain widths in the content boxes at the center of the page to look cohesive. Using overlapping photos to add depth and utilizing a serif type family as the headers and a san-serif as the body text to create an easy hierarchy. Palleted in teals and light blues, this will accomplish making the subject matter seem calm and tranquil and easy to peruse instead of something harsh against Monet’s landscape pieces.</p>

        <h2>Week Three</h2>
        <p>Prompt: This weeks journal prompt, I want you to clearly imagine one user who'll love to use your Project 1 website. This user could be you, it could be someone similar to you, it could be someone completely opposite from you, it could even be a non-human animal or an alien or an amoeba. You get to choose. Really imagine what they are like in their mind. What do they spend their time on? what are their hobbies, clothes, music, favorite foods, books, tv. what's their personality like. Once you've imagined this person. write about them. just a paragraph, three to five sentences. try to have fun with it.</p>
        Response: Someone who I think would love my Project 1 website would be someone who is clearly interested in the Impressionist movement and Impressionism art style; someone who enjoys painting, crafting, and being delicate with their works yet still fast paced to get it done quickly to capture their essences. They spend their time outside a lot and when they’re not you can find this person huddled up at home researching artistic possibilities that they could make. Their hobbies would include painting, playing video games, going out for hikes, and cloud watching. They keep quiet to themselves for the most part but once you get to know this person you really can’t get them to stop talking about how beautiful the things around them are, as well as their need to explore.
