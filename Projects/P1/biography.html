            <h2>1840–1926</h2>
            <section class="biography"> 
                <p>On November 14th, 1840, Oscar Claude Monet was born in Paris, France by his parents Louis and Adolphe Monet. Not too soon after his birth, the family moved to a little port town in the Normandy region in France, named Le Havre. 
                    At an early age, Monet developed a love for drawing. He filled his books with sketches of people. While his mother supported his love for art, his father did not and wanted him to go into business.
                    
                    Later on at Eighteen, Claude was well known in his local community for his detailed caricatures. Where he then met Eugene Boudin, a landscape artist, who influenced Monet to explore the natural world in his paintings. Boudin introduced him to painting outside, or plein air painting, which would later become the cornerstone of Monet's work.</p>
                    
                <p>In 1859, at 19 years old, Monet moved back to Paris and enrolled in Academie Suisse. Here, he immersed himself in the Barbizon school, which emphasized making preliminary sketches outside and then bringing the canvas back indoors to paint the natural world in a controlled environment.</p>
                    
                <p>From 1861 to 1862, Monet served in the military and was stationed in Algiers, Algeria. But he was discharged for health reasons. Returning to Paris, Monet studied with Charles Gleyre. Through Gleyre, he met various other artists like Auguste Renoir, Alfred Sisley, and Frederic Bazille—the four of them to become friends.</p>
                    
                <p>In 1865, Monet won acceptance to the Salon, an annual juried art show in Paris; choosing two of his paintings of marine landscapes. Though Monet's works received some critical praise, he still struggled financially.</p>
                    
                <p>The following year, Monet was selected again to participate in the Salon. This time, the show chose a landscape and a portrait named Camille (or also called Woman in Green), that featured his lover and future wife, Camille Doncieux. Doncieux came from a humble background and was substantially younger than Monet. She served as a muse for him, sitting for numerous paintings during her lifetime. </p>
                    
                <p>They experienced great hardship around the birth of their first son, Jean, in 1867. Monet was in dire financial strains, and his father was unwilling to help. Monet became so despondent over the situation that, in 1868, he attempted suicide by trying to drown himself in the Seine River. Fortunately, Monet and Camille soon caught a break when Louis-Joachim Guadibert became a patron of Monet's work, which enabled the artist to continue his work and care for his family.</p>
                    
                <p>In April 1874, The Society's exhibition proved to be revolutionary. One of Monet's most noted works in the show, "Impression, Sunrise" (1873), depicted Le Havre's harbor in a morning fog. Critics used the title to name the distinct group of artists "Impressionists," saying that their work seemed more like sketches than finished paintings. While it was meant to be derogatory, the term seemed fitting. </p>
                    
                <p>Monet sought to capture the essence of the natural world using strong colors and bold, short brushstrokes; he and his contemporaries were turning away from the blended colors and evenness of classical art. They were also keen to eliminate the color black from their palettes and encouraged this practice at every opportunity. It brought about a new color theory, which emphasized the presence of color, within shadows, and they worked to the rule that there was no black in nature, and therefore, it should not be included in their paintings.</p>
                    
                <p>Monet also brought elements of industry into his landscapes, moving the form forward and making it more contemporary. Monet began to exhibit with the Impressionists after their first show in 1874, and continued into the 1880s.</p>
                    
                <p>Before Camille’s death in 1879, the Monet’s moved in with Ernest and Alice Hoschedé. After her death, Monet painted a grim set of paintings known as the Ice Drift series. He grew closer to Alice, and the two eventually became romantically involved. Ernest spent much of his time in Paris, and he and Alice never divorced.</p>
                    
                <p>In 1883, Monet finally moved to Giverny with Alice along with her six children from her previous marriage and with two children from Monet’s marriage. Giverny was a veritable haven for Monet, a place that would serve as a source of great inspiration for the artist and prove to be his final home in 1890; there the gardens would inspire him to create paintings that are today extremely famous such as the White Water Lily series (les Nymphéas). After Ernest's death, Monet and Alice married in 1892.</p>
                    
                <p>He died December 5th, 1926, in his home surrounded by his family in Giverny, France.</p>
