        <h1>Impressionism</h1>
            <h2>Violation of Academic Painting</h2>
                <p>Claude Monet’s Impression, Sunrise exhibited in 1874, gave the Impressionist movement its name when the critic Louis Leroy accused it of being a sketch or “impression,” not a finished painting. It demonstrates the techniques many independent artists adopted: short, broken brushstrokes that barely convey forms, pure unblended colors, and an emphasis on the effects of light. Rather than neutral white, grays, and blacks, Impressionists often rendered shadows and highlights in color. The artists’ loose brushwork gives an effect of spontaneity and effortlessness that masks their often carefully constructed compositions, such as in Alfred Sisley’s 1878 Allée of Chestnut Trees. This seemingly casual style became widely accepted, even in the official Salon, as the new language with which to depict modern life.

                In addition to their radical technique, the bright colors of Impressionist canvases were shocking for eyes accustomed to the more sober colors of academic painting. Many of the independent artists chose not to apply the thick golden varnish that painters customarily used to tone down their works. The paints themselves were more vivid as well. The nineteenth century saw the development of synthetic pigments for artists’ paints, providing vibrant shades of blue, green, and yellow that painters had never used before.

                        <p>The Salon was the official art exhibition organised by the French Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture. The critics thought it was absurd to sell paintings that looked like unfinished impressions and to present these paintings as finished works.</p>

                        <p>Georges Seurat  (1859–1891) was a painter who became a Neo-Impressionist, who believed that separate touches of interwoven pigment resulted in a greater vibrancy of color in the observer’s eye than is achieved by the traditional way of mixing color pigments on the palette.</p>

                        <p>Edgar Degas (1834–1917) is considered to be one of the major representatives of Impressionism movement, due to his composition and his perspective analysis of motion. He also was one of the most active organizers of the movement.</p>

                        <p>Paul Cézanne (1839–1906) wished to break down objects and landscapes into their most basic geometric constituents and depict their essential building blocks. His works are considered to be the bridge between impressionism and post-impressionism.</p>
