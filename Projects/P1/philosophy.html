            <h2>En Plein Air; The Act of Painting Outdoors</h2>
                <p class="philosophy">Monet’s art philosophy is heavily based on the Impressionist movement, of expressing one's perceptions before nature, especially as applied to plein air landscape painting.

                    On one occasion, Monet had been recorded to put this sentence as the essence of his art philosophy,
                    
                    “I want the unobtainable. Other artists paint a bridge, a house, a boat, and that's the end. They are finished. I want to paint the air which surrounds the bridge, the house, the boat, the beauty of the air in which these objects are located, and that is nothing short of impossible.”
